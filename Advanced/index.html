            <h2>The concept is simple</h2>
            <p> We're a group of book lovers that love to discuss what they've read. All members of the book club read the same book over the same period. At the end of every month, we meet at a bar and discuss the book.Our club is so much more than a book club, we start the conversation around books – but it always leads to deeper more meaningful connection and provides the foundation for lifelong friendships. Join us and discover a wide variety of new books, new authors, new friends and enjoy a glass of wine all at the same time. We’re delighted to welcome you!  </p>

            <h2> What are we reading?</h2> 
            <h4> We are currently reading Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed:</h4>

        <div >
            <p>  A bleak moon settled by utopian anarchists, Anarres has long been isolated from other worlds, including its mother planet, Urras-a civilization of warring nations, great poverty, and immense wealth. Now Shevek, a brilliant physicist, is determined to reunite the two planets, which have been divided by centuries of distrust. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have kept them apart.
                To visit Urras-to learn, to teach, to share-will require great sacrifice and risks, which Shevek willingly accepts. But the ambitious scientist's gift is soon seen as a threat, and in the profound conflict that ensues, he must reexamine his beliefs even as he ignites the fires of change. </p>
